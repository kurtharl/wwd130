    <p>Hi Everyone! I'm from San Jose California, US. I'm 34 and just recently started schooling again with the Pathways program, 
    and it's been a blast. I have too many hobbbies but cheifly among them I love table-top games.
    I also consume far too much media and books and it's been one of the struggles to cut back on those things while taking classes.
    <p>I've been in retail most of my adult life and I sing and perform theater professionally on the side, but I've always had an 
    affinity and interest in technology and computers and want to improve my standard of living through computer science and programing.
    It's been a challenge because this is my first real attempt at higher education but I'm hoping to learn a lot here and I look forward to getting to know you all.</p>
