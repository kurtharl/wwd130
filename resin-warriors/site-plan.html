        Gem Casts is a site for people who have been in the tabletop community for some time and are looking for a luxury set of dice either as a gift or to add to their collection. We provide a variety of styles and color options and have different tiers for our customers depending on how involved they want to be in the process, but I will always have previews before making your dice mold. We have a very limited catalog of ready to buy but still one of a kind dice, usually because I made the set for fun. I offer some guidance to other dice makers in the form of video lessons and  video archive masterclasses.

To look at the custom options head over to “The Dice”, and when you are ready to order or just have a question take a look at our “Order & FAQ” page. The home page will be similar to an about us, and showcase past customer reviews in order to highlight quality. I’ll show past dice creations to give you an idea of what we do exactly, and also explain a bit about me and why I started making dice as well as how I started.

      <h3>The Dice</h3>
      <p>
        “The Dice” contains reference photos of some of our options as well as descriptions of my process from starting with design and concept pours to mold creation and finishing techniques, all to get you to your perfect dice. Dice styles include: “Multi-tones” in swirl, half and half, speckled, tri-tone, and rainbow, “Glow in the dark”, translucent, frosted, sparkling or constellation with an option for glowing specks, liquid core (which can be combined with sparkling), and many more or even some styles based on your desires. I can mold your dice into nearly any shape though I usually recommend one of the standard shapes. If you want a non-standard shape I will do the best I can but sometimes really exotic designs will be prone to fail and either be very expensive or simply impossible. Colors are pretty straight forward and I will accept customer submitted colors but will also offer to work with you on making if you only have a vague idea. Lastly dice sizes come in 12mm, 16mm, 20mm, 25mm, 50mm, 90mm, and 110mm with some expectations for our highest tiers. We also offer wooden boxes instead of our standard satin dice bag when ordering.

      </ul>
      <h3>Order & FAQ</h3>
      <p>
        On “Orders and FAQ” you’ll be able to see a price breakdown of our different tiers as well as a catalog of our available ready to buy dice. Tiers are divided based on what kind of style and shape you want and how many revisions (at minimum 1 full revision with a few test pours), and what level of input you want in the process based on how detailed your dice desires are (specific color vs general color). There will also be a quick design section for people who trust my expertise and just want to make a few selections and place an order. I will also have the very rare dice mold to sell to other enthusiast dice makers, and I offer one on one video lessons on making dice teaching how to achieve some of the more difficult styles and shapes. Dice can be ordered as a single dice in any common numeral (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20, d00) or more commonly as a set of seven (one of each) for tabletop play, or a cube of d6 in 4, 8, 12, 16, or 32. We do have an option for a non-standard number of faces, but some will make the dice naturally uneven and is not recommended.
